                                                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                                                        <em><p style="text-align:justify">Recent studies have identified large scale brain networks based on the spatio-temporal structure of spontaneous fluctuations in resting-state fMRI data.
														It is expected that functional connectivity based on resting-state data is reflective of - but not identical to - the underlying anatomical connectivity.
														However, which functional connectivity analysis methods reliably predict the network structure remains unclear. Here we tested and compared network connectivity
														analysis methods by applying them to fMRI resting-state time-series obtained from the human visual cortex. The methods evaluated here are those previously tested
														against simulated data in Smith et al. (Neuroimage, 2011). To this end, we defined regions within retinotopic visual areas V1, V2, and V3 according to their eccentricity
														in the visual field, delineating central, intermediate, and peripheral eccentricity regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs served as nodes in the models we study.
														We based our evaluation on the "ground-truth", thoroughly studied retinotopically-organized anatomical connectivity in the monkey visual cortex. For each evaluated method,
														we computed the fractional rate of detecting connections known to exist ("c-sensitivity"), while using a threshold of the 95th percentile of the distribution of interaction
														magnitudes of those connections not expected to exist. Under optimal conditions - including session duration of 68min, a relatively small network consisting of 9 nodes and
														artifact-free regression of the global effect - each of the top methods predicted the expected connections with 67-85% c-sensitivity. Correlation methods, including Correlation
														(Corr; 85%), Regularized Inverse Covariance (ICOV; 84%) and Partial Correlation (PCorr; 81%) performed best, followed by Patel's Kappa (80%), Bayesian Network method PC (BayesNet; 77%),
														General Synchronization measures (67-77%), and Coherence (CohB; 74%). With decreased session duration, these top methods saw decreases in c-sensitivities, achieving 59-76% for 17min
														sessions. With a short resting-state fMRI scan of 8.5min, none of the methods predicted the real network well, with Corr (65%) performing best. With increased complexity of the network
														from 9 to 36 nodes, multivariate methods including PCorr and BayesNet saw a decrease in performance. Artifact-free regression of the global effect increased the c-sensitivity of the top-performing
														methods. In an overall evaluation across all tests we performed, correlation methods (Corr, ICOV, and PCorr), Patel's Kappa, and BayesNet method PC set themselves somewhat above all other
														methods. We propose that data-based calibration based on known anatomical connections be integrated into future network studies, in order to maximize sensitivity and reduce false positives.</p>

Cytochrome oxidase (CO), a key component of oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria, is non-uniformly distributed in visual area V1 in distinct blob and interblob regions, suggesting significant spatial variation in the capacity for oxygen metabolism. The goal of this study was to test whether CBF/CMRO2 coupling differed when these subpopulations of neurons were preferentially stimulated, using chromatic and luminance stimuli to preferentially stimulate either the blob or interblob regions. A dual-echo spiral arterial spin labeling (ASL) technique was used to measure CBF and BOLD responses simultaneously in 7 healthy human subjects. When the stimulus contrast levels were adjusted to evoke similar CBF responses (mean 65.4% ± 19.0% and 64.6% ± 19.9%, respectively for chromatic and luminance contrast), the BOLD responses were remarkably similar (1.57% ± 0.39% and 1.59% ± 0.35%) for both types of stimuli. We conclude that CBF–CMRO2 coupling is conserved for the chromatic and luminance stimuli used, suggesting a consistent coupling for blob and inter-blob neuronal populations despite the difference in CO concentration.

This suggestion has been addressed theoretically with models of a single neuron and two coupled neurons. Neural mass models (NMMs) address mean-field based modeling of the activity and interactions between populations of neurons rather than a few neurons. NMMs have been widely employed for studying the generation of EEG rhythms, and more recently as frameworks for integrated models of neurophysiology and functional MRI (fMRI) responses. To date, the consequences of energy constraints on the activity and interactions of ensembles of neurons have not been addressed. Here we aim to study the impact of constraining energy consumption during the resting-state on NMM parameters. To this end, we first linearized the model, then used stochastic control theory by introducing a quadratic cost function, which transforms the NMM into a stochastic linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Solving the LQR problem introduces a regime in which the NMM parameters, specifically the effective connectivities between neuronal populations, must vary with time. This is in contrast to current NMMs, which assume a constant parameter set for a given condition or task. We further simulated energy-constrained stochastic control of a specific NMM, the Wilson and Cowan model of two coupled neuronal populations, one of which is excitatory and the other inhibitory. These simulations demonstrate that with varying weights of the energy-cost function, the NMM parameters show different time-varying behavior. We conclude that constraining NMMs according to energy consumption may create more realistic models. We further propose to employ linear NMMs with time-varying parameters as an alternative to traditional nonlinear NMMs with constant parameters.

The global average fluctuations increase the correlation between functional systems beyond the correlation that reflects their specific functional connectivity. Hence, removal of the GAS is a common practice for facilitating the observation of network-specific functional connectivity. This strategy relies on the implicit assumption of a linear-additive model according to which global fluctuations, irrespective of their origin, and network-specific fluctuations are super-positioned. However, removal of the GAS introduces spurious negative correlations between functional systems, bringing into question the validity of previous findings of negative correlations between fluctuations in the default-mode and the task-positive networks. Here we present an alternative method for estimating global fluctuations, immune to the complications associated with the GAS. Principal components analysis was applied to resting-state fMRI time-series. A global-signal effect estimator was defined as the principal component (PC) that correlated best with the GAS. The mean correlation coefficient between our proposed PC-based global effect estimator and the GAS was 0.97±0.05, demonstrating that our estimator successfully approximated the GAS. In 66 out of 68 runs, the PC that showed the highest correlation with the GAS was the first PC. Since PCs are orthogonal, our method provides an estimator of the global fluctuations, which is uncorrelated to the remaining, network-specific fluctuations. Moreover, unlike the regression of the GAS, the regression of the PC-based global effect estimator does not introduce spurious anti-correlations beyond the decrease in seed-based correlation values allowed by the assumed additive model. After regressing this PC-based estimator out of the original time-series, we observed robust anti-correlations between resting-state fluctuations in the default-mode and the task-positive networks. We conclude that resting-state global fluctuations and network-specific fluctuations are uncorrelated, supporting a Resting-State Linear-Additive Model. In addition, we conclude that the network-specific resting-state fluctuations of the default-mode and task-positive networks show artifact-free anti-correlations.

Resting state executive control network (RS-ECN) represents a novel approach to interrogate the integrity of brain areas underlying executive dysfunction. The present study aims to investigate RS-ECN in aMCI and examine a possible link between changes in brain functional connectivity and declines in executive function. aMCI individuals (n = 13) and healthy subjects (n = 16) underwent cognitive assessment including executive function and high field functional magnetic resonance imaging. Individual RS-ECN maps were estimated using a seed-based cross-correlation method. Between groups RS-ECN functional connectivity comparison was assessed using voxel-wise statistic parametric mapping. aMCI individuals had reduced RS-ECN connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilaterally. In contrast, aMCI showed increased connectivity in ventral lateral and anterior prefrontal cortex, bilaterally. Connectivity strength was associated with executive function in the ACC (r = 0.6213, p = 0.023) and right DLPFC (r = 0.6454, p = 0.017). Coexistence between connectivity declines and recruitment of brain regions outside the RS-ECN as reported here fits a brain reserve conceptual framework in which brain networks undergo remodeling in aMCI individuals.

Until now, these results have been limited to the organization principles of early visual cortex (V1). While the middle temporal area (MT) has been the first identified extra-striate visual area shown to exhibit a columnar organization in monkeys, evidence of MT's columnar response properties and topographic layout in humans has remained elusive. Research using various approaches suggests similar response properties as in monkeys but failed to provide direct evidence for direction or axis of motion selectivity in human area MT. By combining state of the art pulse sequence design, high spatial resolution in all three dimensions (0.8 mm isotropic), optimized coil design, ultrahigh field magnets (7 Tesla) and novel high resolution cortical grid sampling analysis tools, we provide the first direct evidence for large-scale axis of motion selective feature organization in human area MT closely matching predictions from topographic columnar-level simulations</p>

Here, we identified neurons recruited by whisker stimulation in the rat somatosensory cortex using double immunohistochemistry for c-Fos and markers of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and investigated in vivo their contribution along with that of astrocytes in the evoked perfusion response. Whisker stimulation elicited cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases concomitantly with c-Fos upregulation in pyramidal cells that coexpressed cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and GABA interneurons that coexpressed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and/or choline acetyltransferase, but not somatostatin or parvalbumin. The evoked CBF response was decreased by blockade of NMDA (MK-801, −37%), group I metabotropic glutamate (MPEP+LY367385, −40%), and GABA-A (picrotoxin, −31%) receptors, but not by GABA-B, VIP, or muscarinic receptor antagonism. Picrotoxin decreased stimulus-induced somatosensory evoked potentials and CBF responses. Combined blockade of GABA-A and NMDA receptors yielded an additive decreasing effect (−61%) of the evoked CBF compared with each antagonist alone, demonstrating cooperation of both excitatory and inhibitory systems in the hyperemic response. Blockade of prostanoid synthesis by inhibiting COX-2 (indomethacin, NS-398), expressed by ∼40% of pyramidal cells but not by astrocytes, impaired the CBF response (−50%). The hyperemic response was also reduced (−40%) after inhibition of astroglial oxidative metabolism or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids synthesis. These results demonstrate that changes in pyramidal cell activity, sculpted by specific types of inhibitory GABA interneurons, drive the CBF response to whisker stimulation and, further, that metabolically active astrocytes are also required..</p>

                                                        <em><p style="text-align:justify">Multivariate machine learning algorithms applied to human functional MRI (fMRI) data can decode information conveyed by cortical columns, despite the voxel-size being large relative to the width of columns. Several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie decoding of stimulus orientation or the stimulated eye. These include: (I) aliasing of high spatial-frequency components, including the main frequency component of the columnar organization, (II) contributions from local irregularities in the columnar organization, (III) contributions from large-scale non-columnar organizations, (IV) functionally selective veins with biased draining regions, and (V) complex spatio-temporal filtering of neuronal activity by fMRI voxels. Here we sought to assess the plausibility of two of the suggested mechanisms: (I) aliasing and (II) local irregularities, using a naive model of BOLD as blurring and MRI voxel sampling. To this end, we formulated a mathematical model that encompasses both the processes of imaging ocular dominance (OD) columns and the subsequent linear classification analysis. Through numerical simulations of the model, we evaluated the distribution of functional differential contrasts that can be expected when considering the pattern of cortical columns, the hemodynamic point spread function, the voxel size, and the noise. We found that with data acquisition parameters used at 3 Tesla, sub-voxel supra-Nyquist frequencies, including frequencies near the main frequency of the OD organization (0.5 cycles per mm), cannot contribute to the differential contrast. The differential functional contrast of local origin is dominated by low-amplitude contributions from low frequencies, associated with irregularities of the cortical pattern. Realizations of the model with parameters that reflected best-case scenario and the reported BOLD point-spread at 3 Tesla (3.5mm) predicted decoding performances lower than those that have been previously obtained at this magnetic field strength. We conclude that low frequency components that underlie local irregularities in the columnar organization are likely to play a role in decoding. We further expect that fMRI-based decoding relies, in part, on signal contributions from large-scale, non-columnar functional organizations, and from complex spatio-temporal filtering of neuronal activity by fMRI voxels, involving biased venous responses. Our model can potentially be used for evaluating and optimizing data-acquisition parameters for decoding information conveyed by cortical columns.</p>

                                                        <em><p style="text-align:justify">We propose a neural mass model for anatomically-constrained effective connectivity among neuronal populations residing in four layers (L2/3, L4, L5 and L6) within a cortical column. Eight neuronal populations in a given column--an excitatory population and an inhibitory population per layer--are assumed to be coupled via effective connections of unknown strengths that need to be estimated. The effective connections are constrained to anatomical connections that have been shown to exist in previous anatomical studies. The neural input to a cortical column is directed into the two populations in L4. The anatomically-constrained effective connectivity is captured by a system of 16 stochastic differential equations. Solving these equations yields the average postsynaptic potentials and transmembrane currents generated in each population. The current source density (CSD) responses in each layer, which serve as the model observations, are equated in the model to the sum of all currents generated within that layer. The model is implemented in a continuous-discrete state-space framework, and the innovation method is used for estimating the model parameters from CSD data. To this end, local field potential (LFP) responses to forepaw stimulation were recorded in rat area S1 using multi-channel linear probes. LFPs were converted to CSD signals, which were averaged within each layer, yielding one CSD response per layer. To estimate the effective strengths of connections between all cortical layers, the model was fitted to these CSD signals. The results show that the pattern of effective interactions is strongly influenced by the pattern of strengths of the anatomical connections; however, these two patterns are not identical. The estimated anatomically-constrained effective connectivity matrix and the anatomical connectivity matrix shared five of their six strongest connections, although rankings according to connection strength differed. The strongest effective connections were from excitatory neurons in layer 4 to excitatory neurons in layer 2/3. Our study shows the feasibility of estimating anatomically-constrained effective connectivity within a cortical column, and indicates that there is a strong influence of anatomical connectivity on effective connectivity between cortical layers</p>

The mechanism by which low spatial resolution imaging decodes information represented in a fine-scale organization is not clear. To investigate mechanisms underlying decoding signals we employed high-resolution gradient-echo BOLD functional MRI of visual area V1. We show that in addition to the fine-scale ocular dominance columns, coarse-scale structures extending over several millimeters also convey discriminative power for decoding the stimulated eye. Discriminative power is conveyed by both macroscopic blood vessels and gray matter regions. We hypothesize that gray-matter regions which drain into specific vessels may preferentially contain ocular-dominance columns biased towards one eye; the bias of a specific region thereby causing a functionally selective ocular-dominance response in the associated vessel. Our findings indicate that coarse-scale structures and macroscopic blood vessels contribute to decoding of the stimulated eye based on low-resolution multivariate data</p>

Importantly, these spontaneous fluctuations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks. Despite the large body of human imaging literature on spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous. Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at approximately 6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single recording site in V1. To the extent that our V1 findings can be generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting state can be linked to synchronization of slow fluctuations in the underlying neuronal signals.</p>

It can be combined with invasive techniques and afford better understanding of non-invasively acquired brain imaging signals in humans. However, the difficulties in optimal application of alert monkey fMRI are multi-faceted, especially at high magnetic fields where the effects of motion and of changes in B0 are greatly amplified. To overcome these difficulties, strict behavioral controls and elaborate animal-training are needed. Here, we introduce a number of hardware developments, quantify the effect of movements on fMRI data, and present procedures for animal training and scanning for well-controlled and artifact-reduced alert monkey fMRI at high magnetic field. In particular, we describe systems for monitoring jaw and body movements, and for accurately tracking eye movements. A link between body and jaw movement and MRI image artifacts is established, showing that relying on the immobilization of an animal's head is not sufficient for high-quality imaging. Quantitative analysis showed that body and jaw movement events caused large instabilities in fMRI time series. On average, body movement events caused larger instabilities than jaw movement events. Residual baseline brain image position and signal amplitude shifts were observed after the jaw and body movement events ended. Based on these findings, we introduce a novel behavioral paradigm that relies on training the monkeys to stay still during long trials. A corresponding analysis method discards all data that were not obtained during the movement-free periods. The baseline position and amplitude shifts are overcome by motion correction and trial-by-trial signal normalization. The advantages of the presented method over conventional scanning and analysis are demonstrated with data obtained at 7 T. It is anticipated that the techniques presented here will prove useful for alert monkey fMRI at any magnetic field.</p>

Several labs have reported fMRI data from the awake monkey, but none of them has studied and systematically corrected the effects of monkeys' motion on fMRI time series. In this study, a significant refinement of acquisition and correction strategies is reported that can be used to minimize magnetic susceptibility artifacts induced by respiration and by jaw and body movement. Real-time acquisition of sensor signals (e.g., signals induced by jaw and body movement) and MR navigator data were combined to optimize fMRI signal-correction strategies. Within trials, the artifact-induced off-resonance changes were small and mainly reflected the effects of respiration; between trials, movements caused major changes of global frequency and shim (>20 Hz/cm). Several methods were used to assess the stability of the fMRI series: k-space analysis ('dynamic intensity and off-resonance changes in k-space', dubbed DICK and DORK) and image analysis using a Laplace operator and a center-of-mass metric. The variability between trials made it essential to correct for inter-trial variations. On the other hand, images were sufficiently stable with our approach to perform fMRI evaluations on single trials before averaging of trials. Different motion correction strategies were compared: DORK, McFLIRT (rigid body model with three translations and three rotations) and 2D image alignment based on a center-of-mass detection (in-plane translation). The latter yielded the best results and proved to be fast and robust for intra- and inter-trial alignment. Finally, fMRI in the behaving monkey was tested for spatial and temporal reproducibility on a trial-to-trial basis. Highly activated voxels also displayed good reproducibility between trials. On average, the BOLD amplitude response to a short 3-s visual stimulus was close to 2%</p>

The columnar structures of neocortex are prominent examples of such modular organization, and have been studied extensively in anatomical and physiological experiments in rats, cats and monkeys. The importance of noninvasive study of such structures, in particular in human subjects, cannot be overemphasized. Not surprisingly, therefore, many attempts were made to map cortical columns using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Yet, the robustness, repeatability, and generality of the hitherto used fMRI methodologies have been a subject of intensive debate. Using differential mapping in a high magnetic field magnet (7 T), we demonstrate here the ability of Hahn Spin-Echo (HSE) BOLD to map the ocular dominance columns (ODCs) of the human visual cortex reproducibly over several days with a high degree of accuracy, relative to expected spatial patterns from post-mortem data. On the other hand, the conventional Gradient-Echo (GE) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in some cases failed to resolve ODCs uniformly across the selected gray matter region, due to the presence of non-specific signals. HSE signals uniformly resolved the ODC patterns, providing a more generalized mapping methodology (i.e. one that does not require adjusting experimental approaches based on prior knowledge or assumptions about functional organization and vascular structure in order to avoid confounding large vessel effects) to map unknown columnar systems in the human brain, potentially paving the way both for the study of the functional architecture of human sensory cortices, and of brain modules underlying specific cognitive processes.</p>

We quantified the spatial specificity of the BOLD response, and we investigated whether this specificity varies as a function of time from stimulus onset. fMRI was performed at 7 Tesla (T), where mapping signals of parenchymal origin are easily detected. Two abutting visual stimuli were adjusted to elicit responses centered on a flat gray matter region in V1. fMRI signals were sampled at high-resolution orthogonal to the retinotopic boundary between the representations of the stimuli. Signals from macro-vessels were masked out. Principal component analysis revealed that the first component in space accounted for 96.2+/-1.6% of the variance over time. The spatial profile of this time-invariant response was fitted with a model consisting of the convolution of a step function and a Gaussian point-spread-function (PSF). The mean full-width at half-maximal-height of the fitted PSF was 2.34+/-0.20 mm. Based on simulations of confounding effects, we estimate that BOLD PSF in human gray matter is smaller than 2 mm. A time-point to time-point analysis revealed that the PSF obtained during the 3rd (1.52 mm) and 4th (1.99 mm) seconds of stimulation were narrower than the mean PSF obtained from the 5th second on (2.42+/-0.15 mm). The position of the edge of the responding region was offset (1.72+/-0.07 mm) from the boundary of the stimulated region, indicating a spatial non-linearity. Simulations showed that the effective contrast between active and non-active columns is reduced 25-fold when imaged using a PSF whose width is equal to the cycle of the imaged columnar organization. Thus, the PSF of the hyper-oxygenated BOLD response in human gray matter is narrower than that reported at 1.5 T, where macro-vessels dominate the mapping signals. The initial phase of this response is more spatially specific than later phases. Data acquisition methods that suppress macro-vascular signals should increase the spatial specificity of BOLD fMRI. The choice of optimal stimulus duration represents a trade-off between the spatial specificity and the overhead associated with short stimulus duration</p>

In addition to increases in cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) signals, sustained negative responses are pervasive in functional imaging. The origin of negative responses and their relationship to neural activity remain poorly understood. Through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological recording, we demonstrate a negative BOLD response (NBR) beyond the stimulated regions of visual cortex, associated with local decreases in neuronal activity below spontaneous activity, detected 7.15 plusminus 3.14 mm away from the closest positively responding region in V1. Trial-by-trial amplitude fluctuations revealed tight coupling between the NBR and neuronal activity decreases. The NBR was associated with comparable decreases in local field potentials and multiunit activity. Our findings indicate that a significant component of the NBR originates in neuronal activity decreases.</p>

                                                        <em><p style="text-align:justify">At very high magnetic fields, GE BOLD fMRI is expected to contain none specific contributions and behave differently than HSE fMRI data. Similarly, the two approaches can conceivably suffer from different contributions to temporal instabilities in a times series that ultimately determine the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). We investigate the signal and signal fluctuation characteristics in GE and HSE fMRI data with the imaging parameters separately optimized for each contrast at 7 T. In HSE fMRI, activation-induced fractional signal change (DeltaS/S) decreased rapidly, and the ratio of standard deviations of image-to-image fluctuations due to physiological processes (sigmaPhys) to thermal noise (sigmaTherm) remained constant with increasing voxel volume. In contrast, DeltaS/S as well as volume of activated voxels was virtually independent of voxel size for GE BOLD, and sigma(Phys)/sigmaTherm increased with increasing voxel size. The ratio of BOLD signal changes (GE/HSE) was much closer to 1 in tissue areas compared to vessel areas. These observations led to the conclusions that the spatial extent of the activation-induced DeltaS/S was much broader in the GE data, and that the physiological processes that give rise to the temporal fluctuations lost coherence over millimeter distances in HSE compared to GE fMRI data. While further studies are needed to characterize it fully, sigmaPhys in HSE data was clearly different than in GE data. It was concluded that HSE imaging yields a significantly reduced amount of nonspecific signals compared to GE imaging, and, would be the method of choice (over GE) for high-resolution applications in humans.</p>

The role of the feedback connections, however, is unclear. This study was aimed at revealing possible organizational relationships between the feedback projections from area V2 and the functional maps of orientation and retinotopy in area V1. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals was combined with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and connectional anatomy in owl monkeys. Tracer injections were administered at orientation-selective domains in regions of pale and thick cytochrome oxidase stripes adjacent to the border between these stripes. The feedback projections from V2 were found to be more diffuse than the intrinsic horizontal connections within V1, but they nevertheless demonstrated clustering. The clusters of feedback axons projected preferentially to interblob cytochrome oxidase regions. The distribution of preferred orientations of the recipient domains in V1 was broad but appeared biased toward values similar to the preferred orientation of the projecting cells in V2. The global spatial distribution of the feedback projections in V1 was anisotropic. The major axis of anisotropy was systematically parallel to a retinotopic axis in V1 corresponding to the preferred orientation of the cells of origin in V2. We conclude that the feedback connections from V2 to V1 might play a role in enhancing the response in V1 to collinear contour elements.</p>

This method has shown half-rotation orientation singularities (pinwheels) located within regions of low orientation vector magnitude. Direction preference is generally orthogonal to orientation preference, but often deviates from this, particularly in regions of low direction vector magnitude. Linear regions of rapid change in direction preference terminate in or near orientation singularities. The vector-averaging method is problematic however because it does not clearly disambiguate spatial variation in orientation tuning width from variation in height. It may also wrongly estimate preferred direction in regions where preference is weak. In this paper we analyze optical maps of cat visual cortex by fitting model tuning functions to the responses. This new method reveals features not previously evident. Orientation tuning height and width vary independently across the map: tuning height is always low near singularities, however regions of broad and narrow orientation tuning width can be found in regions of low tuning height, often alternating in a spoke-like fashion around singularities. Orientation and direction preference angles are always closely orthogonal. Reversals in direction preference form lines that originate precisely in orientation singularities.</p>

Here, we demonstrate and characterize a robust sustained negative BOLD response (NBR) in the human occipital cortex, triggered by stimulating part of the visual field. The NBR was spatially adjacent to but segregated from the PBR. It depended on the stimulus and thus on the pattern of neuronal activity. The time courses of the NBR and PBR were similar, and their amplitudes covaried both with increasing stimulus duration and increasing stimulus contrast. The NBR was associated with reductions in blood flow and with decreases in oxygen consumption. Our findings support the contribution to the NBR of (1) a significant component of reduction in neuronal activity and (2) possibly a component of hemodynamic changes independent of the local changes in neuronal activity.</p>

														the tight spatial coupling between brain activity and blood flow. Obtaining functional CBF maps with high spatial resolution is a major challenge because the CBF
														signal is intrinsically low and the SNR is critical. In the present work, CBF-based functional imaging was performed at a considerably smaller voxel size than previously
														reported in humans. High-resolution CBF maps were obtained with voxel sizes as small as 0.9 x 0.9 x 1.5 mm(3) in the human brain. High sensitivity was made possible by
														signal-to-noise gains at the high magnetic field of 7 T and by using a novel RF combination coil design. In addition, a reduction of the field-of-view was critical to achieve
														0.9-mm in-plane resolution with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging in a single shot. Functional CBF data were compared with functional BOLD data to reveal that, for CBF, large
														contrast- to-noise gains were obtained at high spatial resolution, indicating that the functional CBF response was more localized. High-resolution functional CBF imaging is
														significant for neuroscience research because it provides better localization and more specific information than BOLD for monitoring brain function.</p>

Decreasing the voxel size and obtaining simultaneously high temporal resolution is a major challenge and is mainly limited by sensitivity. Here, signal-to-noise gains at high magnetic fields (7 Tesla) and an optimized surface coil setup are combined with a novel approach for zoomed functional imaging in the visual cortex. For echoplanar imaging, the acquisition time and segmentation was shortened fourfold by using a reduced field-of-view. An adiabatic outer-volume suppression method, BISTRO, was used to obliterate signal outside the area-of-interest achieving effective suppression even for inhomogeneous B1-fields. A single-shot acquisition was performed at submillimeter resolution in the human brain, while simultaneously maintaining a high temporal resolution of 125 ms. Functional studies with and without field-of-view reduction were performed. Activation and percent change maps were compared with respect to spatial extent, t values and percentage changes of the BOLD contrast. The detection of functional activation was found to be equal within the inter-series variability for the two acquisition schemes. Thus, single-trial BOLD responses were detected for the first time robustly at a 500 x 500 microm2 in plane and 250 ms temporal resolution, significantly expanding the possibilities of event-related functional imaging in the human brain. The magnetization transfer effect induced by the outer-volume suppression pulses was investigated and found to be increased during neuronal activity.</p>

To date, experimental studies of the initial dip in humans have been performed at fields up to 4 T, with relatively low spatial resolution. Because the sensitivity to microvascular contribution is increased at high magnetic fields, the present study investigated the initial dip at 7 T. In addition, to reduce the partial volume effect, the study is conducted at a high spatial resolution. The initial dip was detected in all subjects studied and was found to reside mostly in the gray matter. The relative amplitude of the early response was found to be 0.6, higher than that at 4 T (0.3) and 1.5 T (0.11). In addition, based on the assumption that the initial dip is a result of increased oxygen utilization, the fractional change in oxygen utilization was estimated to be 40% of that of the fractional change in cerebral blood flow. These results are in agreement with the notion that the initial dip arises from an increase in oxygen consumption.</p>

Visual stimulation studies were performed in normal subjects using high-resolution multishot EPI sequences. Changes in R(*)(2) arising from visual stimulation were experimentally determined using fMRI measurements obtained at multiple echo times. The results obtained at 7 T were compared to those at 4 T. Experimental data indicate that fMRI can be reliably performed at 7 T and that at this field strength both the sensitivity and spatial specificity of the BOLD response are increased.

                                                        <em><p style="text-align:justify">Revealing the layout of cortical maps is important both for understanding the processes involved in their development and for uncovering the mechanisms underlying neural computation. The typical organization of orientation maps in the cat visual cortex is radial; complete orientation cycles are mapped around orientation singularities. In contrast, long linear zones of orientation representation have been detected in the primary visual cortex of the tree shrew. In this study, we searched for the existence of long linear sequences and wide linear zones within orientation preference maps of the cat visual cortex. Optical imaging based on intrinsic signals was used. Long linear sequences and wide linear zones of preferred orientation were occasionally detected along the border between areas 17 and 18, as well as within area 18. Adjacent zones of distinct radial and linear organizations were observed across area 18 of a single hemisphere. However, radial and linear organizations were not necessarily segregated; long (7.5 mm) linear sequences of preferred orientation were found embedded within a typical pinwheel-like organization of orientation. We conclude that, although the radial organization is dominant, perfectly linear organization may develop and perform the processing related to orientation in the cat visual cortex.</p>

Optical imaging was used to record the activity of populations of neurons. We found a patchy distribution of cortical regions exhibiting preference for one direction over the opposite direction of motion. The degree of clustering according to preference of direction was two to four times smaller than that observed for orientation. In general, direction preference changed smoothly along the cortical surface; however, discontinuities in the direction maps were observed. These discontinuities formed lines that separated pairs of patches with preference for opposite directions. The functional maps for direction and for orientation preference were closely related; typically, an iso-orientation patch was divided into regions that exhibited preference for opposite directions, orthogonal to the orientation. In addition, the lines of discontinuity within the direction map often connected points of singularity in the orientation map. Although the organization of both domains was related, the direction and the orientation selective responses were separable; whereas the selective response according to direction of motion was nearly independent of the length of bars used for visual stimulation, the selective response to orientation decreased significantly with decreasing length of the bars. Extensive single and multiunit electrical recordings, targeted to selected domains of the functional maps, confirmed the features revealed by optical imaging. We conclude that significant processing of direction of motion is performed early in the cat visual pathway.</p>

														<p style="text-align:justify"> In the past decade, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research has been focused on the acquisition of physiological and biochemical information noninvasively. Probably the most notable accomplishment in this
														general effort has been the introduction of the MR approaches to map brain function. This capability, often referred to as functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is based on the sensitivity of MR signals
														to secondary metabolic and hemodynamic responses that accompany increased neuronal activity. Despite this indirect link to neurotransmission, recent studies demonstrate that under appropriate conditions, these fMRI
														maps have accuracy at the scale of submillimeter neuronal organizations such as the orientation columns of the visual cortex, and are directly proportional in magnitude to electrical signals generated by the neurons.
														High magnetic fields have been critical in achieving such specificity in functional maps because they provide advantages through increased signal-to-noise ratio, diminishing blood-related contributions to mapping signals,
														and enhanced sensitivity to microvasculature. Equally important is MR spectroscopy studies, which, at high magnetic fields, provide for the first time the opportunity to measure local metabolic correlates of human brain
														function and neurotransmission rates. Together, these MR methods provide a complementary set of approaches for probing important aspects of the nervous system</p>
